Automated Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System
This repository contains the source code for an automated greenhouse monitoring and control system developed using Arduino. The system utilizes a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and a relay to control the watering system. Communication with the system is facilitated through a Telegram bot, allowing users to remotely monitor and control the greenhouse environment.

Features
Monitors temperature and humidity of the greenhouse environment.
Controls the watering system based on predefined conditions.
Allows remote monitoring and control via Telegram bot commands.
Supports configuration of temperature thresholds and WiFi credentials.
Getting Started
To get started with the system, follow the instructions provided in the manual. You'll need an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, a DHT11 sensor, a relay, and access to the Telegram bot API.

Usage
Set up the hardware components according to the provided instructions.
Upload the provided code to your microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
Configure the WiFi SSID, password, Telegram bot token, and chat ID in the code.
Power on the microcontroller and ensure it is connected to the WiFi network.
Send commands to the Telegram bot to interact with the system.
